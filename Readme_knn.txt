# Diabetes Prediction using KNN

## Description
This project predicts whether a person has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. 
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is used along with hyperparameter optimization using Optuna.

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Data Preprocessing (scaling, handling imbalance)
3. Train/Test Split
4. KNN Model Training
5. Hyperparameter Optimization with Optuna
6. Model Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall)

## Results
- Accuracy: XX% (to be updated after running)
- Confusion Matrix: See `results/confusion_matrix.png`

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/diabetes_knn.ipynb
